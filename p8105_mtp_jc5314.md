## Introduction:

An article described relationship between posture and enlarged
protuberances. The researchers analyzed data from individuals with
different ages and sex, and concluded that prominent exostosis were more
prevalent in young adults than older groups. However, skepticism arose
about this study and a published author correction indicated errors
existed in the original work. In this project, dataset from this study
was used to test whether issues exist and reproduced results are
consistent with that reported in the article.

## 1\. Dataset

### 1.1 Description

``` r
raw_data = 
  read_excel("./data/p8105_mtp_data.xlsx", skip = 8)
```

``` r
mtp_data =   
  raw_data %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  replace_na(list(eop_size_mm = 0, eop_shape = 0)) %>% 
  mutate(
    sex = as.character(sex),
    age = as.integer(age),
    age_group = case_when(
      age_group %in% c('6', '7', '8') ~ '6+', 
      TRUE ~ age_group ),
    age_group = factor(age_group, levels = c('1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6+')),
    eop_size = factor(eop_size, levels = c('0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5')),
    eop_visibility_classification = factor(eop_visibility_classification, levels = c('0', '1', '2')),
    eop_shape = as.character(eop_shape),
    fhp_category = factor(fhp_category, levels = c('0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7'))
  )

str(mtp_data)
```

    ## Classes 'tbl_df', 'tbl' and 'data.frame':    1221 obs. of  9 variables:
    ##  $ sex                          : chr  "1" "1" "0" "1" ...
    ##  $ age                          : int  18 26 22 20 27 28 17 21 25 30 ...

In the data cleaning, missing values were filled based on given
information, variable types were modified and orders were given to
factor variables. Individuals older than 60 were all assigned as ‘6+’
under the `age_group` variables to facilitate further analyses.

The resulting dataset `mtp_data` contains 1221 observations (i.e. the
number of participants) and 9 variables. Key variables: The average
**age** was 45.5118755. The average **EOP size** was 6.8330549 mm. The
average **FHP size** was 26.1013416 mm. `NA` exist in the `fhp_size_mm`
and `eop_shape`. Since no information was provided, `NA`’s here were
left blank.

A table below shows the age and gender distribution.

``` r
mtp_data %>% 
  mutate(
    age_group = case_when(
      age_group == '1' ~ 'less than 18',
      age_group == '2' ~ '18-30',
      age_group == '3' ~ '31-40',
      age_group == '4' ~ '41-50',
      age_group == '5' ~ '51-60',
      age_group == '6+' ~ 'larger than 60'
    )
  ) %>% 
  group_by(sex, age_group) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = sex,
    values_from = n
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable(
    col.names = c('Age', 'Female', 'Male'),
  )
```

| Age            | Female | Male |
| :------------- | -----: | ---: |
| 18-30          |    151 |  152 |
| 31-40          |    102 |  102 |
| 41-50          |    106 |  101 |
| 51-60          |     99 |  101 |
| larger than 60 |    155 |  150 |
| less than 18   |      1 |    1 |

### 1.2 Issues

``` r
mtp_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age_group, y = age, color = age_group)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = c(18, 31, 41, 51, 61), color = 'red', linetype = 'dotted') + 
  xlab('Age Group') +
  ylab('Age (years)') +
  scale_color_hue(name = "age group") +
  scale_x_discrete(
    labels = c("<18's", "18-29 years","30's", "40's", "50's", ">60's")) +
  scale_color_hue(name = "age group",
                  labels = c("<18's", "18-29 years","30's", "40's", "50's", ">60's"))
```

<img src="p8105_mtp_jc5314_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="90%" />

  - An outlier in ‘\<18’s’ group indicates a person older than 18 was
    mistakenly labeled into this group.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
mtp_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = eop_size, y = eop_size_mm, color = eop_size)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = c(5, 10, 15, 20, 25), color = 'red', linetype = 'dotted') + 
  xlab('EOP Size Group') +
  ylab('EOP Size (mm)') +
  scale_color_hue(name = "eop size group")
```

<img src="p8105_mtp_jc5314_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="90%" />

  - Misclassifications existed in EOP size group, especially in group 1,
    3, 4, 5.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
row_na = which(is.na(pull(mtp_data, eop_size)))
raw_data[row_na,] %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| Sex | Age | Age group | EOP size (mm) | EOP size | EOP visibility Classification | EOP Shape | FHP size (mm) | FHP Category |
| --: | --: | :-------- | ------------: | :------- | ----------------------------: | --------: | ------------: | :----------- |
|   1 |  62 | 6         |            15 | 14.6     |                             2 |         2 |          40.8 | 4            |

The `NA` in x-axis was due to an abnormal value ‘14.6’ in ‘EOP size’ in
raw dataset which supposed to be 0 ~ 5.

``` r
mtp_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = eop_visibility_classification, y = eop_size_mm, color = eop_visibility_classification)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = c(0, 5), color = 'red', linetype = 'dotted') + 
  xlab('EOP Visibility Classification') +
  ylab('EOP Size (mm)') +
  scale_color_hue(name = "EOP visibility classification")
```

<img src="p8105_mtp_jc5314_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="90%" />

  - Misclassifications existed in all three groups in EOP visibility
    classification.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
mtp_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fhp_category, y = fhp_size_mm, color = fhp_category)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = c(0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70), color = 'red', linetype = 'dotted') + 
  xlab('FHP Size Group') +
  ylab('FHP Size (mm)') +
  scale_color_hue(name = "FHP size group")
```

<img src="p8105_mtp_jc5314_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="90%" />

  - Misclassifications existed in FHP size group, especially in group 1,
    2, 4.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
row_na = which(is.na(pull(mtp_data, fhp_category)))
raw_data[row_na,] %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| Sex | Age | Age group | EOP size (mm) | EOP size | EOP visibility Classification | EOP Shape | FHP size (mm) | FHP Category |
| --: | --: | :-------- | ------------: | :------- | ----------------------------: | --------: | ------------: | :----------- |
|   0 |  51 | 5         |            NA | 0        |                             0 |        NA |          30.3 | 30.8         |

The `NA` in the x-axis was due to an abnormal value ‘30.8’ in ‘FHP
Category’ in raw dataset which supposed to be 0 ~ 7.

## 2\. Visualization Improvement

``` r
fhp_plot =
  mtp_data %>% 
  filter(age_group != '1') %>% 
  drop_na(fhp_size_mm) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age_group, y = fhp_size_mm, fill = sex)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  stat_summary(
    fun.y = mean, aes(colour = "Mean"), 
    geom = "point", 
    shape = 18, 
    size = 3,
    position = position_dodge(width = 0.75)) +
  stat_summary(
    fun.data = mean_se, 
    geom = "errorbar",
    width = 0.15,
    position = position_dodge(width = 0.75)) +
  scale_fill_hue(
    name = "Sex", 
    labels = c("Females", "Males")) +
  scale_colour_manual(
    values = c("Mean" = "darkred"), 
    labs(colour = '')) +
  xlab('Age Group (years)') +
  ylab('FHP Size (mm)') +
  scale_x_discrete(
    labels = c("18-29 years","30's", "40's", "50's", ">60's"))
```

``` r
eeop_plot = 
  mtp_data %>% 
  filter(age_group != '1') %>% 
  mutate(
    eeop = case_when(
      eop_size_mm > 10 ~ 'y',
      eop_size_mm <= 10 ~ 'n'
    )
  ) %>% 
  group_by(age_group, sex) %>% 
  count(eeop) %>%
  mutate(rate = prop.table(n)) %>% 
  filter(eeop == 'y') %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = rate, x = age_group)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = sex, color = sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_hue(
    name = "Sex", 
    labels = c("Females", "Males")) +
  xlab('Age Group (years)') +
  ylab('EEOP Rate (%)') +
  scale_x_discrete(
    labels = c("18-29 years","30's", "40's", "50's", ">60's"))
```

``` r
# create a two-panel figure and show the plot

fhp_plot / eeop_plot
```

<img src="p8105_mtp_jc5314_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="90%" />

From upper panel, mean value equals to median in most of the age groups,
indicating a non-skewed distributions in those data. For females in
30’s, 50’s, \>60’s group, data distributions were right-skewed. Also,
the males had relatively larger FHP size than females.

From lower panel, overall trend of EEOP rate decreased first and then
increased. It had largest rate in 18-29 years group and lowest rate in
40’s group. Also, EEOP rates in males were higher than that in females
at all age groups.

``` r
fhp_eop_plot = 
  mtp_data %>% 
  filter(age_group != '1') %>% 
  drop_na(fhp_size_mm) %>% 
  filter(eop_size_mm != 0) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fhp_size_mm, y = eop_size_mm, color = sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(
    method = "lm", 
    color = 'black',
    se = FALSE) +
  facet_grid(
    sex ~ age_group, 
    labeller = as_labeller(c('0' = 'Female', '1' = 'Male', '2' = '18-29 years', 
                             '3' = "30's", '4' = "40's", '5' = "50's", '6+' = ">60's"))) +
  xlab('FHP Size (mm)') +
  ylab('EOP Size (mm)') +
  scale_color_hue(
    name = "Sex", 
    labels = c("Females", "Males"))

fhp_eop_plot
```

<img src="p8105_mtp_jc5314_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="90%" />

For male group, the EOP size and FHP size had slightly positive
relationships in all age groups. However, for female group, the
relationships were not identical among different age groups.

## 3\. Reproduce Reported Results

``` r
mtp_data %>% 
  mutate(
    age_group = case_when(
      age_group == '1' ~ 'less than 18',
      age_group == '2' ~ '18-30',
      age_group == '3' ~ '31-40',
      age_group == '4' ~ '41-50',
      age_group == '5' ~ '51-60',
      age_group == '6+' ~ 'larger than 60'
    )
  ) %>% 
  group_by(age_group) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  knitr::kable(
    col.names = c('Age Group', 'Sample Size')
  )
```

| Age Group      | Sample Size |

| 51-60          |         200 |
| larger than 60 |         305 |
| less than 18   |           2 |

  - Sample sizes in each age group from available data were not
    consistent with authors stated.

| Male   |        28.51234 |                      14.66670 |

  - Reported mean and standard deviations for FHP size were consistent
    with that in available data.

| Not EEOP    |    829 |  0.6789517 |

  - EEOP: When bony outgrowths exceeded 10 mm in size.
  - Variable used to evaluate the prevalence of EEOP was `eop_size_mm`.
    The EEOP prevalence from available data was 32%, which has 1%
    difference from what authors reported.

| Age Group | Percentage of FHP \>40 mm |
| :-------- | ------------------------: |
| 6+        |                 0.3245902 |

  - In older age group, more people had higher FHP size and the
    percentages of large-FHP categories increased. Thus, the broad
    trends are consistent with the article. However, based on available
    data, the percentage of FHP \>40 mm observed is 32.5%, which is not
    consistent with the article.

## 4\. Discussions

Based on the available data, lots of misclassification were found in
category variables and mistakes were found in data entry, which made the
data analyses in original report questionable. Besides, some statistical
values were found not consistent with that reported in the article.
Although board trends were consistent with the article that younger
individuals had higher EEOP rates, we still cannot conclude cell phones
cause hron growth. Extra data showing the prevalence of cell-phones
usage among different age groups will be necessary to better address
such hypothesis.
